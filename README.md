# Why?

Because I want to be able to say

``files = MultipleFileField(upload_view=’order_upload’)``

in my model and have a nice ajaxy field with multiple drag and drop of files, with icons that represent their mimetypes and previews of image files.

# hasn’t someone done this already?

probably, but I’m using ajaximageuploader for help in this

# why is this documentation not so good?

temporary documentation will replace later
